# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to take a look into the Pewlett Hackard employees who will be eligible for retirement in the near future. This will allow the company to plan ahead and see if any of those eligible would be interested in becoming mentors, rather than retiring and leaving the company once they reach their retirement age. The mentorship program will allow years of knowledge and experience to be passed on to the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees and can help the company learn and grow.

## Results

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Of the 30% of employees who will be retiring, only 1549 are qualified enough to become mentors within the company. This covers 0.6% of the current number of employees, and is only 2% of the retiring employees. While any level of mentorship will be beneficial, this is not enough to cover the losses from this next wave of retirees. It may be a good idea to plan for the mentorship program at least 5-10 years before retirement to try to bring those numbers up. 

The Development, Production, and Sales departments have the most prospective mentorship opportunities during this current wave
